 * ### Coordinate system
 *
 * Right now there is no specific convention on where a tracking systems
 * coordinate system is centered, and is something we probably need to figure
 * out. Right now the stereo based tracking system used by the PSVR and PSMV
 * tracking system is centered on the camera that OpenCV decided is origin.
 *
 * To go a bit further on the PSVR/PSMV case. Think about a idealized start up
 * case, the user is wearing the HMD headset and holding two PSMV controllers.
 * The HMD's coordinate system axis are perfectly parallel with the user
 * coordinate with the user's coordinate system. Where -Z is forward. The user
 * holds the controllers with the ball pointing up and the buttons on the back
 * pointing forward. Which if you read the documentation of @ref psmv_device
 * will that the axis of the PSMV are also perfectly aligned with the users
 * coordinate system. So everything "attached" to the user has its coordinate
 * system parallel to the user's.
 *
 * The camera on the other hand is looking directly at the user, its Z-axis and
 * X-axis is flipped in relation to the user's. So to compare what is sees to
 * what the user sees, everything is rotated 180Â° around the Y-axis.
